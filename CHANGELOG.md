### Changed

- BayesBase requires Julia 1.10 or later, the oldest version its CI tests.
- The code is formatted with [Runic](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Runic.jl) instead of
  JuliaFormatter: `make format` and `make check-format`, and the `Format` workflow in CI.
- The tooling follows the ReactiveBayes PackageTemplate: the Makefile, the CI, CompatHelper,
  TagBot and documentation preview workflows, and the documentation setup.
