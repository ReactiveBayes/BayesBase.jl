## [Product API](@id library-prod)

The `prod` function defines an interface to compute a product between two probability distributions over the same variable.
It accepts a strategy as its first argument, which defines how the prod function should behave and what results you can expect.

```@docs
prod(::UnspecifiedProd, left, right)
BayesBase.default_prod_rule
```

### [Product strategies](@id library-prod-strategies)

For certain distributions, it's possible to compute the product using a straightforward mathematical equation, yielding a closed-form solution. 
However, for some distributions, finding a closed-form solution might not be feasible. 
Various strategies ensure consistent behavior in these situations. 
These strategies can either guarantee a fast and closed-form solution or, when necessary, fall back to a slower but more generic method.

```@docs
BayesBase.UnspecifiedProd
BayesBase.ClosedProd
BayesBase.PreserveTypeProd
BayesBase.PreserveTypeLeftProd
BayesBase.PreserveTypeRightProd
BayesBase.GenericProd
BayesBase.ProductOf
BayesBase.LinearizedProductOf
BayesBase.TerminalProdArgument
BayesBase.resolve_prod_strategy
```

These strategies offer flexibility and reliability when working with different types of distributions, ensuring that the package can handle a wide range of cases effectively.
